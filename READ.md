# CGPA Calculator

The CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) calculator is a useful tool for students to calculate their overall academic performance. It takes into account the grades obtained in different courses and provides a cumulative average score.

## How does it work?

The CGPA calculator works by assigning a numerical value to each grade and then calculating the weighted average based on the credit hours of each course. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use it:

1. Gather your course information: Make a list of all the courses you have taken or are currently taking. Note down the course name, credit, and the grade obtained.

2. Assign numerical values to grades: Each grade is assigned a numerical value based on the grading system used by your institution. For example, an "A" might be assigned a value of 4, while a "B" might be assigned a value of 3.

3. Calculate the weighted average: Multiply the credit of each course by the numerical value of the grade obtained. Sum up these values for all courses. Divide the total by the sum of the total credit to get the CGPA.

4. Interpret the CGPA: The CGPA is usually on a scale of 4.0 and 5.0.
